# Atom Wrap Style

Select word warp style in Atom.

This package breaks lines in accordance with the styles of [CSS Text Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/), and you can select styles. It provides accurate word wrap for texts with proportional fonts and non-latin characters(CJK, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc...), those breaking rules.

This package conflicts [atomicchar](https://atom.io/packages/atomicchar),
[japanese-wrap](https://atom.io/packages/japanese-wrap), and so on. Please use only one of them, and disable or uninstall others.

If you want hard-wrap, please set "Style Word Break" to "break-all".
