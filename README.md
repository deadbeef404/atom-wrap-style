# Atom Wrap Style

Select word warp style in Atom.

This package breaks lines in accordance with the styles of [CSS Text Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/), and you can select styles. It provides accurate word wrap for texts with proportional fonts and non-latin characters(CJK, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc...).

This package conflicts [atomicchar](https://atom.io/packages/atomicchar),
[japanese-wrap](https://atom.io/packages/japanese-wrap), and so on. Please use only one of them, and disable or uninstall others.

### TODO
* [ ] More fast (-ะด-;
* [ ] To refer to atomicchar
* [ ] No React? Uuumm...
* [ ] Use shadow DOM
